# Equivalence

This is an implementation of Tarjan's Union-Find algorithm (Robert
E. Tarjan. "Efficiency of a Good But Not Linear Set Union
Algorithm", JACM 22(2), 1975) in order to maintain an equivalence
relation.
  
This implementation is a port of the *union-find* package using the
ST monad transformer (instead of the IO monad).
